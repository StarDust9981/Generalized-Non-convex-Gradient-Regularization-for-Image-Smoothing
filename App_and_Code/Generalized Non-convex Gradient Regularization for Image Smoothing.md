**Abstract**

The edge- and structure-preserving smoothing is one of the most vital topics in the field of multimedia signal processing, as it can be applicable to a variety of tasks. In this paper, to cater to the wide range of applications, we propose a novel optimization model based on a generalized non-convex gradient regularization for edge-preserving image smoothing. The proposed model is highly flexible, thus facilitating varying smoothing behaviors. Furthermore, we extend our model to suit the task of structure-preserving filtering by proposing a novel non-local data term. The non-local design incorporates the spatial scale support and thus can be effective for the separation of the scale-dependent textures and structures. We propose an efficient solution based on the additive half quadratic minimization and Fourier domain optimization so that the edge- and structure-preserving filtering can be facilitated in a unified framework. We have experimented with the proposed filter on a number of low-level vision tasks. Both quantitative and qualitative experiment results indicate the superiority of the proposed filter over the state-of-the-art filters. Moreover, the proposed filter is highly efficient, it is able to process 720P color images in real time (more than 20 fps) on an NVIDIA RTX 3070 GPU. Therefore, it can be practical for real applications.
